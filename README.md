Sorts
=====

Visual representation of several common sorting algorithms


I have implemented versions of bubblesort, insertionsort, and quicksort
with added printing statements within to show the inner workings of 
these algorithms. More to come soon.

NOTE: the quicksort has a partition policy of the rightmost element
